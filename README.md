Manuscript abstract:
This study examined how race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and sexual orientation intersect to socially pattern depression among US adults. We used cross-sectional data from the 2015-2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH; n=234,772) to conduct design-weighted intersectional multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) for two binary outcomes: past-year and lifetime major depressive episode (MDE). With 42 intersectional groups constructed from seven race/ethnicity, two sex/gender, and three sexual orientation categories, we estimated group-specific prevalence and excess/reduced prevalence attributable to intersectional effects (i.e., two-way or higher interactions of identity variables). Models revealed considerable heterogeneity between intersectional groups, with prevalence estimates ranging from 3.4–31.4% (past-year) and 6.7–47.4% (lifetime). Estimates were generally higher among groups inclusive of people who were Multiracial, White, women, gay/lesbian, or bisexual. Additive effects explained most between-group variance; however, approximately 3% (past-year) and 12% (lifetime) was attributable to intersectional effects, with some groups experiencing excess/reduced prevalence. Sexual orientation (43.2–55.4%) explained a greater proportion of between-group outcome variance relative to race/ethnicity (10.1–17.4%) and sex/gender (7.5–7.9%). Notably, we extend prior intersectional MAIHDA applications by utilizing complex sample survey weights, thus opening opportunities to apply this method to quantify intersectionality with weighted survey data.
